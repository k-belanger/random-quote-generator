## Project Objective:
Create an app that displays random quotes each time a button is clicked using JavaScript and complete all "Exceeds Expectation" criteria.

## Project Functions:
- when button is clicked a random quote from the quotes array, with author and optional citattion and year is displayed on the screen.

## Exceeds Expectations:
- background color of page and button randomly changes when new quote is displayed, and no color is repeated until all colors have been used.
- no quote is repeated until all of the quotes have been cycled through, and quotes are logged in the console for seeing this
- the array of quotes has an additional property of 'tags' which contains an array of tags that categorize the quote
- a new quote is automatically displayed after 20 seconds have passed. If the button is clicked the interval time is reset.
