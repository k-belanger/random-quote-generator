## Project Objective:
Create an app that displays random quotes each time a button is clicked using JavaScript and complete all "Exceeds Expectation" criteria.

## Project Functions:
When button is clicked a random quote from the quotes array, with author and optional citation and year, is displayed on the screen.

## Exceeds Expectations:
- The background color of page and of the button randomly changes when a new quote is displayed. No color is repeated until all the colors have been used.
- No quote is repeated until all the quotes in the quotes array have been cycled through. The quotes are logged to the console in order to verify this.
- The array of quotes has an additional property of 'tags' which contains an array of tags that categorize the given quote.
- A new quote is automatically displayed after 20 seconds have passed. If the button is clicked the interval time is reset.
